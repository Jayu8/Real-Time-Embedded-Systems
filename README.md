# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems

The following objectives are satisfied using the STM32F303 Discovery Board.

1. Counting the number of steps taken using an internally-connected ACCELEROMETER 
2. Measuring the Heart-Rate using an externally-connected PULSE-SENSOR.
3. Transfering the values obtained from both the measurements serially using an externally-connected SERIAL-BLUETOOTH-MODULE.   
4. Developed a GUI using MATLAB to display the results in real-time.
