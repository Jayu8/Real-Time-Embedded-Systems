# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems

The following objectives were satisfied using the STM32F303 Discovery Board.

1. Counting the number of steps taken using an internally-connected ACCELEROMETER.
2. Measuring the Heart-Rate using an externally-connected PULSE-SENSOR through analog pins.
3. Transfering the values obtained from both the measurements serially (one byte(xx in hex) for heart and other for steps count) using an externally-connected SERIAL-BLUETOOTH-MODULE through UART protocol.   
4. Developed a GUI using MATLAB to display the results in real-time.
